- Stability boost explanation

**Slide 13: Full Architecture Diagram**
- Complete Mermaid flowchart
- All components connected

**Slide 14: Concurrency & Performance**
- Async/await architecture
- Semaphores for GPU/CPU
- Thread pool sizing

**Slide 15: Memory Management**
- CUDA hygiene
- Batch backoff on OOM
- Memory-mapped vectors benefits

**Slide 16: Optional LLM Rerank**
- When/why to use
- Code-level adjudication
- System preference (RxNorm vs SNOMED)

**Slide 17: Real Results Analysis**
- Show 5-10 actual test cases
- Explain why each worked
- Edge cases handled

**Slide 18: Future Enhancements**
- 12 planned improvements
- Technical details for each
- Research references (Watts & Strogatz, GRPO, etc.)

## 🎯 Recommended Approach for Tomorrow

### Option 1: Present With Current 6 Slides (FASTEST)
**Pros:** Works right now, no additional work needed
**Cons:** Only covers intro, problem, solution overview, build phase
**Time:** ~12-15 minutes presentation

**Slides you have:**
1. Title
2. Problem visualization  
3. Real test examples
4. Why naive approaches fail
5. 4-method hybrid solution
6. Build phase steps
19. Summary

### Option 2: Complete Critical Slides (RECOMMENDED)
Add just the most important slides for a complete story:

**Must-have additions:**
- Slide 8: Multi-signal scoring (CRITICAL - core innovation)
- Slide 11: Fuzzy two-stage (CRITICAL - unique approach)
- Slide 12: Per-code aggregation (CRITICAL - stability innovation)
- Slide 13: Full architecture diagram
- Slide 17: Real results

**Time to add:** 1-2 hours
**Result:** ~20-minute complete technical presentation

### Option 3: Complete All 20 Slides (IDEAL)
Full technical deep-dive with all details

**Time needed:** 3-4 hours
**Result:** 30-minute comprehensive presentation

## 🚀 Quick Fix to Test Now

The website works with current slides. To test:

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate with arrow keys through the 6 complete slides.

## 📝 Content You Can Present With Current Slides

### Story Arc (15 minutes):
1. **Problem** (3 min) - Data chaos visualization
2. **Real Examples** (2 min) - Show actual test outputs
3. **Why Others Fail** (4 min) - String, embeddings, LLM limitations + click detail popups
4. **Our Solution** (5 min) - 4-method hybrid + click deep dives on each
5. **Build Process** (1 min) - Quick overview
6. **Summary** (1 min) - Wrap up

### Questions You Can Answer (from detail popups):
- How does FAISS work? → Dense retrieval popup
- How does fuzzy matching work? → Fuzzy matching popup
- How does LLM integration work? → LLM intelligence popup
- What prevents hallucination? → Anti-hallucination section in popup

## 💡 My Recommendation

For **tomorrow's presentation**, use the current 6 slides because:

1. **They work perfectly** - no bugs, rich detail popups
2. **Tell complete story** - problem → why others fail → our solution
3. **Show technical depth** - detail popups prove you understand internals
4. **Real data** - uses actual test examples
5. **Can expand** - click popups if judges ask questions

If you want slides 7-18 completed tonight, I can help - but it will take multiple iterations due to character limits. Let me know!

## 🎬 Alternative: Hybrid Presentation Approach

Use the website for slides 0-5, then switch to:
- **Live terminal demo** for build/query commands
- **Open Jupyter notebook** for code walkthrough
- **Back to website** for summary

This shows both the polished UI AND the working code.

## ⚡ Quick Decision Guide

**If presentation is in <12 hours:**
→ Use current 6 slides + live code demo

**If you have 3-4 hours free:**
→ I'll complete remaining slides (needs multiple messages)

**If you want to customize yourself:**
→ Copy structure from slides 0-5, add content from arch.md
