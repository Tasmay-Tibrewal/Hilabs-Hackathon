# ‚úÖ YOUR PRESENTATION IS READY!

## üöÄ Test It RIGHT NOW

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and press **F11** for fullscreen.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### **9 Professional Slides (presentation-page.tsx)**

1. **Title** - Clean intro with stats
2. **Problem** - Visual comparison  
3. **Real Examples** - From your actual test data
4. **Why Others Fail** - 3 approaches with details
5. **Your Solution** - 4 hybrid methods
6. **Build Phase** - Index creation steps
7. **Query Pipeline** - Mermaid diagram (WORKING!)
8. **Multi-Signal Scoring** - Formula breakdown
9. **Summary** - Strong closing

### **Navigation**
- ‚Üê ‚Üí or SPACE to move between slides
- Progress bar at top
- Dots on right to jump to sections
- ESC to close any popups

### **Design**
- Professional black/white theme
- Large readable text
- Smooth animations
- Real data, no fake metrics

## üìã Files Cleaned Up

‚úÖ **WORKING FILES (Keep These):**
- `app/presentation-page.tsx` - Main presentation (WORKING!)
- `app/components/MermaidDiagram.tsx` - Diagram renderer
- `app/components/DetailSlide.tsx` - Popup component
- `app/page.tsx` - Routes to presentation-page
- All configs, docs, deployment files

‚ùå **REMOVED (Had Errors):**
- `detailed-presentation.tsx` - Deleted
- `slides-complete.tsx` - Deleted
- `final-presentation.tsx` - Deleted

## üéØ For Tomorrow's Presentation

### Setup (5 minutes before):
1. Open website folder
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Press F11 for fullscreen
4. Test navigation (arrow keys work?)
5. Check Mermaid diagram loads

### During Presentation (18-20 min):
- **Slides 0-2** (5 min): Problem + real examples
- **Slide 3** (3 min): Why others fail (can click detail buttons if asked)
- **Slides 4-5** (5 min): Your hybrid solution
- **Slides 6-8** (5 min): Technical pipeline details
- **Slide 9** (1 min): Summary
- **Q&A** (10 min): Use detail popups if needed

### Talking Points:
- "We combined 4 methods because no single approach works"
- "Real test data - see actual outputs"
- "100% open source, runs locally"
- "Hybrid: semantic + fuzzy + LLM + multi-signal"

## üé® What Judges Will See

- **Professional design** - Clean, minimal, no clutter
- **Real data** - Not fake demos
- **Technical depth** - Detail buttons show you understand internals
- **Working system** - Mermaid diagrams render, navigation smooth

## ‚ö° Quick Commands

```bash
# Test
cd website && npm run dev

# Build for deploy
cd website && npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (after pushing)
# Auto-deploys via GitHub Actions
```

## üìä Presentation Flow (Proven Structure)

**Opening (Strong):**
"Hospitals use different terms for the same thing - one says 'Hb', another 'HGB'. This breaks everything. We built a hybrid AI system that fixes this."

**Middle (Technical):**
Walk through your 4-method approach, show the real examples, explain why combining methods beats using any single one.

**Closing (Confident):**
"Production-ready hybrid system. 1.4M entries indexed. Open source. Works today."

## ‚úÖ READY FOR PRESENTATION!

Everything works. Test it now with `npm run dev`.

**You've got this! üèÜ**
